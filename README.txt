EN2533 ROBOT DESIGN AND COMPETITION 2022


Physical Task

The physical task will consist of 4 subtasks.
~ Line Maze
~ Curved wall
~ Blind box
~ Line following


Line Maze
The line maze will be handled in two stages.

Exploration stage
The robot will start from the starting square (white) and it will get the opportunity to explore the maze. The exploration stage will end when the robot reaches the white checkpoint square on the opposite side of the maze. There will be no loops in the maze, and only 90-degree turns will exist.

Speeding stage
The robot will have to calculate the shortest path using the data taken in the exploration stage and find its way back to the starting square from the checkpoint through the shortest path. Marks allocation for this stage will depend on how fast the robot will return to the starting square.


Curved Wall
Once the robot reaches the starting square after completing the line maze, it has to follow a curved wall to the left of the robot to reach the blind box (Figure 3). The robot should not touch or go beyond the red line while following the curved wall. If the robot crosses the red line, a penalty will be imposed. The wall will be parallel to the entry point to the maze, and the gap between the starting square of the maze and the start of the wall is less than or equal to 100mm. The entrance to the blind box is located at the end of the wall, and the robot should enter the blind box.


Blind box
Blind box will contain three openings. One is the entrance, another opening will be the wrong exit and the final opening will be the correct exit. A line will be located on the floor near the correct exit. The robot must come out of the box via the correct exit and should follow the line to reach its final destination square. If the robot hits the blind box walls, which will be evident from the motion of the blind box, a penalty will be imposed.


Line Maze Dimensions
~ Starting square and ending square are 25cm x 25cm.
~ The width of the line is 30mm.
