# Robot Design and Competition

This repository contains the files related to the semester 3 module EN2533: Robot Design and Competition. The competition consisted of 2 tasks: a Simulation Task and a Physical Task.


### Simulation Task

For the simulation task, participants were expected to design a virtual robot using the Webots Open-Source Simulator (version R2021b). The virtual robot's performance was evaluated in three tasks:

1.  **Line Following:** The robot had to accurately follow a white line on a black surface, which could include both straight and curved sections.
2.  **Segmented Wall Following:** The robot needed to follow a segmented wall with various shapes, including straight and curved sections.
3.  **Chessboard Area Exploration:** The robot played the role of a black rook in a chess game and was tasked with delivering a checkmate in one move. After achieving this, it could explore the chessboard arena and perform additional tasks.

The virtual robot had to complete these tasks while adhering to detailed simulation specifications, including realistic sensor and actuator configurations.

### Physical Task

The physical robot, built according to specified robot specifications, underwent testing in three subtasks:

1.  **Line Maze Exploration:** The robot began at a starting square and explored a maze without loops, using only 90-degree turns, until reaching a white checkpoint square on the opposite side. Marks were allocated based on the speed of return to the starting square via the shortest path.
2.  **Curved Wall Following:** After completing the line maze, the robot had to follow a curved wall without crossing a red line, reaching a blind box entrance located at the end of the wall.
3.  **Blind Box Navigation:** The robot entered the blind box, which contained three openings – the entrance, a wrong exit, and the correct exit. The robot had to exit through the correct exit and follow a line to reach its final destination square.

The physical robot's performance was evaluated based on its accuracy and efficiency in completing these tasks.
